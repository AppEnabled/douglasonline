It will give you a basic design, but one that is very flexible and customisable, so it's easy to stamp your own identity on it. This wizard will build the page structure with the colours you want, and also help you choose where you want all the main store features to be.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Style of Design </strong></p>\r\n    <p>The first thing you need to do is decide whether your design is going to shrink and grow dynamically with the browser window, or whether it's always going to stay the same size ('Fixed Width'). </p>\r\n    <p>If you decide on a fixed width, you need to also decide whether you want it to be in the centre of the page, or at the left hand side of the page. </p>\r\n    <p><strong>Width</strong></p>\r\n    <p>You will also need to set a width for your design. If you are planning to have two sidebars, your design will need to be at least 900 pixels in width in order to allow enough room for all the content. Any less, and it's going to look a bit squashed.</p>\r\n	<p>&nbsp; </p>\r\n	<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<!-- InstanceEnd --></html>",0,"",0,0,0

The most important layout is called the 'Overall Layout'  (also known as the 'Outer Layout'). This is the layout which controls  everything other than the page contents (i.e. the sections and products).  Overall layouts can contain:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>The content within the  &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; tags (including page title and meta tags).</li>\r\n      <li>Logo and navigation elements  that go across the top of each page.</li>\r\n      <li>Navigational elements that go  down the side of each page.</li>\r\n      <li>Footer elements.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>To read more about overall layouts see <a href=""#help_0x0000203e"">this section in the help</a>.</p>\r\n    <p>The Dreamweaver plug-in will take an  existing page design and turn it into a new overall layout in Actinic.

If you have  a design that you want to use with Actinic, make a copy of it called  'actinic-design.html' or something like that. </p>\r\n    <p> This is because you will need to make  some changes to this file that will not make sense outside of the Actinic  context.</p>\r\n    <p>You will also need to make some changes  to how the design elements are structured (e.g. how you use sub-folders) so  it's quite a good idea to put it in its own folder as well. </p>\r\n    <p><strong>Don't use any sub-folders</strong></p>\r\n    <p>When you register the design, Actinic  will scan through all the image files referenced by the design file and CSS  files to make sure they will preview correctly within Actinic, and will be  uploaded to the online store. </p>\r\n    <p> For a variety of reasons, when you store  your CSS or images in sub-folders, Actinic has trouble working out where all  the image files are and so this can cause problems with previewing and  uploading.</p>\r\n    <p>So before you register your design, move  any CSS files and image files to the same directory level as your main design  file, and change the references within the design file and the CSS file as  required.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Put quotes around images in your CSS file</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Dreamweaver doesn't require you to use  quote marks around image names in your CSS file, but Actinic does.</p>\r\n    <p>So any references similar to:</p>\r\n    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; background-image:  url(top-banner.jpg);</p>\r\n    <p>will need to change to</p>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; background-image:  url('top-banner.jpg');</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Move all your files to the site folder</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Finally, you need to move your design  file, together with all the CSS and images, to the Actinic 'site folder'. <br>\r\n      This is usually located within 'My  Documents' within a folder called 'Actinic v9\Sites'.</p>\r\n    <p> This is important to do as when you  back-up or transfer this design, all the design files will all be backed up and  transferred correctly.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Next  steps:</strong></p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Details of how you actually register your design with Actinic are in <a href=""design-dw-4.html"">this page</a>.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n    <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->\r\n    <p style=""text-align: right;""><a href=""#top"">Back to top</a></p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=""help"">\r\n	<div id=""help-content"">\r\n	<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name=""Help"" -->\r\n\r\n\r\n	<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<!-- InstanceEnd --></html>",0,"",0,0,0
